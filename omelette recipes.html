    <h3>Omelette</h3>
    <p>Very easy and fast to make, for breakfast or as a side dish. This unfolded omelette with crispy, bronzed edges and a soft middle is so delicious even on its own.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium red onions</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon rock salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground white pepper</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dice red and yellow onions into 3 different sizes.</li>
        <li>Combine eggs, onions, chili powder, turmeric, rock salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pour in egg mixture, making sure it's evenly distributed in the skillet.
